## Welcome!

My name is David J DeBonis and I'm so happy you stumbled across my profile (even if by accident)! 

Github already provided a lovely outline, so for now I will fill in the blanks!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few projects!
  1. I am translating [the code of a coffee cooperative simulation](../../../cafelytics) from MatLab to Python to make it open source and more accessible! This is one step we are taking to promote our agricultural consulting firm, Mind the Grow.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and Python. To be more specific, I am trying to learn how to utilize more types of data in C++, and I'm focusing on NLP in Python.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on NLP projects! I am still new to NLP, but I have a very dense linguistic background (specifically in second language acquisition [SLA](../../IPA_vowel_compare) and thus a fresh perspective to bring to the table!

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with recurrent neural networks!

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what my abitions are.
