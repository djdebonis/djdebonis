## Welcome!

My name is David J DeBonis and I'm so happy you stumbled across my profile (even if by accident)! 

Github already provided a lovely outline, so for now I will fill in the blanks!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few projects!
  1. I am developing [the code of a coffee cooperative simulation](https://github.com/djdebonis/cafelytics). We have just translated the original code from MatLab to Python to make it open source and more accessible, and now we are working on improving the software itself to follow better architectural practices. This is one step we are taking to promote our agricultural consulting firm, Mind the Grow.
  2. I am writing a series of C++ programs that parse through markdown files and do things with the formatting data. The other day I quickly wrote a [program](https://github.com/djdebonis/makeReadmeToc) that automatically creates a table of contents for a Github README or markdown file based on existing headers.
  3. I am working on applying for a full time software development or data science position, which I'd like to land by May 2021 at the latest! I'm working on an interactive resume and CV [here](https://github.com/djdebonis/resume).
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and Python. To be more specific, I am trying to learn how to utilize more types of data in C++, and I'm focusing on packaging and engineering in Python.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on NLP projects! I am still new to NLP, but I have a very dense linguistic background (specifically in second language acquisition [SLA](https://github.com/djdebonis/IPA-vowel-compare) and thus a fresh perspective to bring to the table!

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with recurrent neural networks!

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what my abitions are.
