## Welcome!

### David J DeBonis

I am helping to develop [the code of a coffee cooperative simulation](https://github.com/djdebonis/cafelytics). Last year we translated the original code from MatLab to Python to make it open source and more accessible, and now we are working on refactoring the software itself to follow better architectural practices. This is one step we are taking to promote [Mathematical Michael's](https://github.com/mathematicalmichael) agricultural consulting firm, Mind the Grow.
