## Welcome!

### David J DeBonis

I am helping to develop [the code of a coffee cooperative simulation](https://github.com/djdebonis/cafelytics). We have just translated the original code from MatLab to Python to make it open source and more accessible, and now we are working on improving the software itself to follow better architectural practices. This is one step we are taking to promote our agricultural consulting firm, Mind the Grow.
