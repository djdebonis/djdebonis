## Welcome!

My name is David J DeBonis and I'm so happy you stumbled across my profile (even if by accident)! 

Github already provided a lovely outline, so for now I will fill in the blanks!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few projects!
  1. I am translating [the code of a coffee cooperative simulation](https://github.com/djdebonis/cafelytics) from MatLab to Python to make it open source and more accessible! This is one step we are taking to promote our agricultural consulting firm, Mind the Grow.
  2. I am writing a series of C++ programs that parse through markdown files and do things with the formatting data. The other day I quickly wrote a [program](https://github.com/djdebonis/makeReadmeToc) that automatically creates a table of contents for a Github README or markdown file based on existing headers.
  3. I am working on applying for a full time software development or data science position! I'm working on a resume and CV [here](https://github.com/djdebonis/resume).
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and Python. To be more specific, I am trying to learn how to utilize more types of data in C++, and I'm focusing on NLP in Python.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on NLP projects! I am still new to NLP, but I have a very dense linguistic background (specifically in second language acquisition [SLA](https://github.com/djdebonis/IPA-vowel-compare) and thus a fresh perspective to bring to the table!

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with recurrent neural networks!

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what my abitions are.
